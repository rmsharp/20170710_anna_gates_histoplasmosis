This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(rmsutilityr, quietly = TRUE)
library(grid, quietly = TRUE)
library(animalr, quietly = TRUE)
library(xtable, quietly = TRUE)
library(RODBC, quietly = TRUE)
library(ggplot2, quietly = TRUE)
library(reshape2, quietly = TRUE)
library(lubridate, quietly = TRUE)
library(stringi, quietly = TRUE)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(XLConnect, quietly = TRUE))

library(histoplasmosisr, quietly = TRUE)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r get-list-of-affected-animals}
filename <- "../inst/extdata/Copy of Histo Boon Sharp 20140716.xls"
histo_data <- loadWorkbook(filename)
arc_species_code = 'PC'
conn <- odbcConnect("frogstar-vortex-animal-sa")
original_df <- get_affected_animals_df(conn, histo_data, arc_species_code)
exp_df <- original_df
```
This next section gets age and sex matched controls.
```{r get-age-sex-matched-controls}
ctrl_df <- get_ctrl_df(conn, exp_df, arc_species_code)

## This next line is needed if controls are not found for all animals 
exp_df <- exp_df[exp_df$id %in% ctrl_df$match_id, ]
exp_df <- add_match_id(ctrl_df, exp_df)

```
This section looks up the location of each affected animal and its control
for each day of life prior to the diagnosis date and classifies it according
to one of the `r length(get_housing_types(conn))` housing types 
(`r get_and_or_list(names(get_housing_types(conn)))`).
```{r add-historical-housing-types}
X_exp <- "X_exp"
X_ctrl <- "X_ctrl"
housing_types <- get_housing_types(conn)
daily_exp_df <- make_daily_location(conn, X_exp, exp_df, housing_types)
daily_ctrl_df <- make_daily_location(conn, X_ctrl, ctrl_df, housing_types)
threshold_min_percent <- 0

```
The code below uses the daily housing type data to calculate the percent of
life spent in each housing type. Animals must have at least 
`r threshold_min_percent` of their housing history on record to be included in 
the study.
```{r calculate-housing-type-percents}
exp_housing_df <- add_location_type_percents(exp_df, daily_exp_df, 
                                     threshold_min_percent)
ctrl_housing_df <- add_location_type_percents(ctrl_df, daily_ctrl_df, 
                                      threshold_min_percent)

#merged_df <- merge(daily_df, df, by = "id")

```
One of the sources of histoplasmois infection is soil, which makes housing in 
the corral a potential risk factor. However, there were 
`r round(100.0 - percent_exp_animals_ever_in_corral, 0)` percent
of the affected animals that had never been in the corral.
```{r sample-housing-data}
library(knitr)
caption <- stri_c("Housing history for six of ", length(exp_df_to_be_melted), 
                  " affected animals.")
knitr::kable(exp_df_to_be_melted[1:6, ], caption = caption)
caption <- stri_c("Housing history for six of ", length(exp_df_to_be_melted), 
                  " control animals.")
knitr::kable(ctrl_df_to_be_melted[1:6, ], caption = caption)

```
```{r get-housing-type-ratios}
exp_df <- get_housing_type_ratios(conn, exp_df, housing_types, arc_species_code)

```
The contrast we want to look at now is whether or not there is a sex 
difference among those animals being observed with histoplasmosis. 
There are a few issues that should be considered.

  1. There are not equal numbers of males and females.
  2. There are different proportions of males and females.
  3. It is not known if males and females are examined at the same rate.
  
  The following analysis counts all of the males and females on each of the 
  dates on which an animal was diagnosed to have histoplasmosis.

```{r get-male-female-ratios}

exp_df <- get_male_female_ratio(conn, exp_df, arc_species_code)

affected_males <- length(exp_df$sex[exp_df$sex == 'M'])
affected_females <- length(exp_df$sex[exp_df$sex == 'F'])

total_males <- sum(exp_df$males)
total_females <- sum(exp_df$females)

```
```{r simple-chisquare-analysis-of-sex-ratio}
sex_exp_vs_total_m <- matrix(c(affected_females,
                        total_females,
                        affected_males,
                        total_males), nrow = 2)
sex_exp_vs_total_chisq <- chisq.test(x = sex_exp_vs_total_m)
sex_exp_vs_total_m
sex_exp_vs_total_chisq

```
```{r monti-carlo-simulation-analysis}

stat_f <- get_stat_f("sex") # Returns a function that calculates the frequency 
                            # of males
sex_mce <- get_mce(c('M', 'F'), ntrials = 100000, exp_df$male_prob, 
                   length(exp_df$id[exp_df$sex == 'M']) / nrow(exp_df), stat_f)
sex_mce
alpha <- 0.01
sex_exp_vs_total_rr <- calc_relative_risk(sex_exp_vs_total_m, alpha = alpha)
sex_exp_vs_total_rr

```
The relative risk of a female versus a male of being diagnosed as having 
histoplasmosis is `r round(sex_exp_vs_total_rr$RR, 2)` with a 
`r round((1.0 - sex_exp_vs_total_rr$alpha) * 100.0, 0)` percent confidence of 
`r signif(sex_exp_vs_total_rr$lowervalue, 3)` -- 
`r signif(sex_exp_vs_total_rr$uppervalue, 3)`.
