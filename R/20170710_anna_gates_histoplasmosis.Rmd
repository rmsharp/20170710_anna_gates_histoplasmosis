The next section of code will look for histoplasmosis in SqlMed data.

The initial search limited the search to where the _TEST_ID_ was 25 and
the _TEST_NAME_ was 
"WRIGHT STAIN:", however, it was discovered that in most cases the _TEST_ID_ was
398 and there is no _TEST_NAME_

This code finds all of the positive results and puts them in a dataframe
(_sqlmed_df_). It then finds the first observation for each animal and discards
subsequent observations leaving a second dataframe with the first observation
for each animal (_sqlmed_first_df_).
```{r get-sqlmed-histoplasmosis, cache = TRUE}
sql_txt <- stri_c(
  "select obr.animal_id as id, cd.arc_species_code, obr.VERIFIED_DATE_TM,

sqlmed_df <- sqlQuery(conn, sql_txt, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

sqlmed_first_df <- sqlmed_df[order(sqlmed_df$id, 
                                   format(sqlmed_df$OBSERVATION_DATE_TM, 
                                          format = "%Y-%m-%d")), ]

            list(sqlmed_df, sqlmed_first_df), 
            sheetnames = c("all_histo", "first_histo"))

sqlmed_first_df <- sqlmed_first_df[ , c("id", "OBSERVATION_DATE_TM")]
sqlmed_first_df$OBSERVATION_DATE_TM <- 
  as.Date(sqlmed_first_df$OBSERVATION_DATE_TM)

```
We want to find out the earliest date of diagnosis. That is was it the 
physical assessment or was it the pathology laboratories Wright Stain diagnosis.

To do that we need to compare the affected_df\$first_noted date to the 
sqlmed_df\$OBSERVATION_DATE_TM.

The next few lines of code first use merge() to create a new dataframe 
affected_sqlmed_df that has animals in both affected_df and sqlmed_df.
This makes comparison of affected_df\$first_noted date to the 
sqlmed_df\$OBSERVATION_DATE_TM easier. 

This information will be used to update the first_noted column in affected_df.

```{r first-diagnosis, cache = TRUE}
affected_sqlmed_df <- merge(affected_df, 
                       sqlmed_first_df[ , c("id", "OBSERVATION_DATE_TM")],
                       by = "id", all = FALSE)
affected_sqlmed_df$sqlmed_first <- format(affected_sqlmed_df$first_noted, 
                                  format = "%Y-%m-%d") > 
  format(affected_sqlmed_df$OBSERVATION_DATE_TM, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
use_sqlmed_date_df <- affected_sqlmed_df[affected_sqlmed_df$sqlmed_first, ]
## Both dataframes are ordered by id at this point.
affected_df[affected_df$id %in% use_sqlmed_date_df$id, ]$first_noted <- 
  use_sqlmed_date_df$OBSERVATION_DATE_TM
names(sqlmed_first_df) <- c("id", "first_noted")
affected_df <- rbind(affected_df, 
                     sqlmed_first_df[!sqlmed_first_df$id %in% affected_df$id, ])
affected_df2 <- affected_df
## This is the number of new Ids from the SqlMed search
length(affected_df2$id[!affected_df2$id %in% affected_df1$id])

```

This will add supplimental data used for some later analyses.

```{r add-supplimenta-data, cache = TRUE}
affected_df <- add_supplimental_data(conn, affected_df)
affected_df3 <- affected_df
affected_df3[!affected_df3$id %in% affected_df2$id, ]

```
Of the `r length(unique(sqlmed_df$id))` animals that were found to be
positive for _POSITIVE FOR H. CAP.VAR. DUBOISII_,
`r length(unique(sqlmed_df$id[sqlmed_df$arc_species_code == "PC"]))` are 
baboons.


This next section gets age and sex matched controls.
```{r get-age-sex-matched-controls, cache = TRUE}
ctrl_df <- get_ctrl(conn, affected_df, arc_species_code)

## This next line is needed if controls are not found for all animals 
affected_df <- affected_df[affected_df$id %in% ctrl_df$match_id, ]
affected_df4 <- affected_df
affected_df4[!affected_df4$id %in% affected_df3$id, ]

affected_df <- add_match_id(ctrl_df, affected_df)
affected_df5 <- affected_df
affected_df5[!affected_df5$id %in% affected_df4$id, ]

```
This section looks up the location of each affected animal and its control
for each day of life prior to the diagnosis date and classifies it according
to one of the `r length(get_housing_types(conn))` housing types 
(`r get_and_or_list(names(get_housing_types(conn)))`).
```{r add-historical-housing-types, cache = TRUE}
X_affected <- "X_affected"
X_ctrl <- "X_ctrl"
housing_types <- get_housing_types(conn)
daily_affected_df <- make_daily_location(conn, X_affected, affected_df, 
                                         housing_types)
daily_ctrl_df <- make_daily_location(conn, X_ctrl, ctrl_df, housing_types)
threshold_min_percent <- 0

```
The code below uses the daily housing type data to calculate the percent of
life spent in each housing type. Animals must have at least 
`r threshold_min_percent` of their housing history on record to be included in 
the study.
```{r calculate-housing-type-percents, cache = TRUE}

```
One of the sources of histoplasmois infection is soil, which makes housing in 
the corral a potential risk factor. However, there were 
`r round(100.0 - percent_affected_animals_ever_in_corral, 0)` percent
of the affected animals that had never been in the corral.

The contrast we want to look at now is whether or not there is a sex 
difference among those animals being observed with histoplasmosis. 
There are a few issues that should be considered.

  1. There are not equal numbers of males and females.
  2. There are different proportions of males and females.
  3. It is not known if males and females are examined at the same rate.
  
  The following analysis counts all of the males and females on each of the 
  dates on which an animal was diagnosed to have histoplasmosis.

```{r get-male-female-ratios, cache = TRUE}

These data are in an Excel workbook (_`r existing_excel`_).

There were `r nrow(affected_clinic_df)` clinical records found for

The affected animal without clinical records is

They are recorded within the Excel workbook named _`r affected_clinic`_.

The next section looks at CBC and clinical chemistry values for the affected 
animals 
as closest to the date of diagnosis as possible. If the CBC and clinical 
chemistry values are over one year from the date of diagnosis they are ignored.

Of those `r nrow(cbc_df[cbc_df$clin_path_days < 365, ])` had
CBC values recorded within a year of the first noted date.
The CBC values collect closest to the first_noted date and
the subset of those which were less than one year from the first noted date
are recorded within the Excel workbook named _`r cbc_chem`_.



There were `r nrow(chem_df)` animals with clinical chemistry records of the

Debbie Newman is going to run a polygenenic analysis on a pedigree constructed
of individuals related to the affected animals. The list of affected animals
is the animals from the original list plus the animals found with the Wright
Stain in SqlMed.

          append = FALSE, sep = ", ", row.names = FALSE)

```
The IDs of `r length(ids)` affected animals were written to a comma separated
value (CSV) file (_`r genetic_test`_).
